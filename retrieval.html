        <h3> What is it?
</h3>
        <p>Retrieval Practice is the act of remembering something or “bringing it to mind” as learning scientists say. This could be simply trying to write down everything you know about a subject on a blank page, or taking a practice test or using flash cards (if done correctly). The key is to not use notes or readings and just try to remember on your own. </p>
        <p>Research has shown this to be one of the most effective study techniques.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="why">
        <h3>Why is it Effective?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stronger Connections: the process of searching your memory for an item makes it easier to find that memory later. It’s like there is a path through the jungle to the thing you want to remember and each time go down the path it gets clearer and easier to follow.</li>
            <li>More Refined: each time you access your memory it changes a bit and gets better organized and stored in your memory.</li>
            <li>More Connections: our memories are connected to each other and the more we access them</li>
            <li>Know what you know and don’t’ know: going through the process shows you want you remember and what you don’t so you know what you need to work on.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Use Retrieval Practice</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Take a practice test.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Make Flash cards. Take time and think hard before flipping the card over.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Draw a diagram of what you know from memory.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Check Yourself: a very important part of Retrieval Practice is to check yourself for accuracy. After a practice test check your answers. After you write down all you know on a sheet of paper check notes and readings to see what you missed.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="When">
        <h3>When to Use Retrieval Practice</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> When you have time before a test/quiz etc. (it’s not something that works as well the night before). </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li> Other than that retrieval practice can be used in most classroom situations. That’s part of why it’s an effective technique. </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="Tips">
        <h3>Tips & Tricks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If you don’t have access to a practice test, ask your professor for one or make your own if there is no one available.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li> You can collaborate with friends to make tests using tools like Quizlet, Kahoot or even Google or Microsoft Forms.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Don’t just cram the night before. By practicing retrieval multiple times over a period of time you create the strongest, most connected, longest lasting memories.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Retrieval practice is NOT rereading notes, listening to lectures or similar activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>It can feel hard, especially at first. That’s OK! This difficulty is part of learning and forming memories.</li>
        </ul>
