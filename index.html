          <h2>Smart Study Skills 
</h2>
           <div class="skills"><h3>Retrieval Practice</h3>
The act of trying to remember ideas, through techniques like flash cards to practice tests, actually helps make it easier to remember those ideas and connect them to each other.
</div>
           <div class="skills"><h3>Spaced Practice</h3>
This simple method of spacing out your studying makes a big difference in helping to form lasting memories.
</div>
           <div class="skills"><h3>Elaboration</h3>
Use your own words and add details to the concepts you’re learning to make them your own and make it easier to recall them later.
</div>
           <div class="skills"><h3>Interleaving</h3>
Instead of studying the same things in the same order over and over, try mixing things up with Interleaving. 
</div>
           <div class="skills"> <h3>Concrete Examples</h3>
It’s easier to remember ideas that we can visualize and connect to ideas we already know. Learning and creating specific examples of abstract concepts does just that.
</div>
           <div class="skills"><h3>Dual Coding</h3>
<p>Combine visuals like pictures, diagrams or your own drawings, with text gives your brain more to latch on to and more pathways to remember.</p>
