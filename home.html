            <h2>Smart Study Skills </h2>
            <div class="skills">
                <h3>Retrieval Practice</h3>
                <p>The act of trying to remember ideas, through techniques like flash cards to practice tests, actually helps make it easier to remember those ideas and connect them to each other.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="skills">
                <h3>Spaced Practice</h3>
                <p>This simple method of spacing out your studying makes a big difference in helping to form lasting memories.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="skills">
                <h3>Elaboration</h3>
                <p>Use your own words and add details to the concepts you’re learning to make them your own and make it easier to recall them later.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="skills">
                <h3>Interleaving</h3>
                <p>Instead of studying the same things in the same order over and over, try mixing things up with Interleaving.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="skills">
                <h3>Concrete Examples</h3>
                <p>It’s easier to remember ideas that we can visualize and connect to ideas we already know. Learning and creating specific examples of abstract concepts does just that.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="skills">
                <h3>Dual Coding</h3>
                <p>Combine visuals like pictures, diagrams or your own drawings, with text gives your brain more to latch on to and more pathways to remember.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="skills">
                <h3>Featured Skill: Retrieval Practice</h3>
                <p>Retrieval Practice is one of the most effective skills and you can use it for multiple subjects. It’s a great place to start trying out the skills on this site.</p>
            </div>
            <div class=The path>
              <h3>The Path Analogy</h3>
              <p>Throughout the site we will make an analogy between remembering something and finding a location in a forest or jungle. The skills on the site help you make easy-to-follow paths through the forest that help you get to your destination more easily (remember something).</p>
